# Tombstone

A tombstone can be a general term for a marker that signals "this data is no longer here."

For example, in filesystems it can be more efficient to mark the data as "dead" (thus the terminology) and rather than reclaim space, kick off (or wait for) an asynchronous process to reclaim the space.
